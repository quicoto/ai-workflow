# Code changes summary

Please do the following and generate a markdown summary for me I can easily copy and paste:

The markdown command will provide a structured reflection including these:

```markdown
- **📋 Summary of Changes** - High-level overview of what was accomplished
- **🔧 Technical Modifications** - Specific code changes and implementations
- **✅ Features Added** - New functionality and capabilities
- **🐛 Issues Fixed** - Bugs resolved and problems addressed
- **♿ Accessibility Improvements** - UX/accessibility enhancements
- **🧪 Testing Updates** - Test coverage and quality improvements
- **📚 Documentation Changes** - README updates, comments, and docs
```

Do not create a file but return it in the chat as a code block.
