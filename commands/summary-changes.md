# Code changes summary

Please do the following and generate a markdown summary for me:

1. **Analyzes Recent Changes** - Review git commits, file modifications, and code changes
2. **Categorizes Updates** - Group changes by type (features, fixes, refactoring, etc.)
3. **Identifies Key Components** - Highlight which files and components were modified
4. **Validates React Patterns** - Check adherence to @react-development.mdc guidelines
5. **Reviews UI Component Usage** - Ensure proper use of the ui folder for reusable components
6. **Identifies Extraction Opportunities** - Suggest components that could be moved to ui folder
7. **Summarizes Impact** - Explain the business value and technical improvements
8. **Provides Context** - Link changes to requirements, issues, or user stories

## Example Output
